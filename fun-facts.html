    <p>  Poodles are super smart, in fact, they are the second smartest dog in the world.</p>
    <p> Poodles are hypoallergenic: they don't shed. That's why they are often bred with other dogs, to  to make breeds such as a Yorkie Poo, Labradoodle, and Goldendoodle as well as several others breeds.</p>
    <p> Poodles are France's national dog - but they're actually from Germany, where they were called Pudel, which is German for "puddle." </p>
    <p> Poodles were bred to hunt ducks in the water. Their famously fancy cut was actually made so that they could swim efficiently in the cold water (or "puddle")!</p>
